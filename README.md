# Pandas_data_analysis
# Employee Data Analysis using Pandas

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a beginner-friendly **data analysis project** built using **Python and Pandas**. The goal of the project is to analyze employee data and extract meaningful insights related to salaries, departments, experience, and joining dates.

This project was created as a **hands-on practice** to strengthen core Pandas concepts such as data cleaning, aggregation, grouping, feature engineering, and datetime handling.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset (`data.csv`) contains employee-related information with the following columns:

* **EmployeeID** – Unique ID for each employee
* **Name** – Employee name
* **Department** – Department (IT, HR, Finance, etc.)
* **Age** – Employee age
* **Salary** – Monthly/annual salary
* **Experience_Years** – Total years of experience
* **Joining_Date** – Date when the employee joined the company

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

The following analysis tasks were completed in this project:

* Data loading and inspection
* Data cleaning (datetime conversion, duplicate checking)
* Basic statistics (average age, average salary)
* Department-wise analysis using `groupby`
* Salary analysis (highest paid employee, above-average salaries)
* Experience analysis (most experienced employee, department-wise experience)
* Feature engineering:

  * Salary in thousands (`Salary_in_K`)
  * Senior level classification
* Datetime analysis:

  * Joining year extraction
  * Oldest and newest employee
* Business insights:

  * Most expensive department
  * Department with the most experienced staff
